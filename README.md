# Parameter Sweep for Hes1 Tissue Model
We try to find parameters which result in stable oscillations for the given PDE system

$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial d}{\partial t} &= D_d \frac{\partial^2 d}{\partial x^2} + \alpha_d n - \mu_d d,\\
    \frac{\partial m}{\partial t} &= \frac{\alpha_m}{1+p^h} - \mu_m m,\\
    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &= \alpha_p m - \mu_p p,\\
    \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} &= \frac{\alpha_n (1+d)}{1+p^{\gamma}} - \mu_n n, \\
\end{align}
$$

describing how the protein Hes1 is involved in signalling between cells during embryonal development using Matlab's PDE Toolbox. In this case the involved molecules are

$$
\begin{align}
    &\text{d(t,x): Dll1 protein}, \\
    &\text{m(t,x): Hes1 mRNA}, \\
    &\text{p(t,x): Hes1 protein}, \\
    &\text{n(t,x): Ngn2 protein}.
\end{align}
$$

Since data concerning the required parameter values are difficult to determine, we perform a parameter sweep over several parameters in the system to determine their influence on the system's behaviour and, hopefully, find more fitting parameter values than the initially chosen ones.


## Computational Environment

## Executing the Code

### Main Parameter Sweep Files
To execute the parameter sweep using the sequential solver, the file `Hes1_tissue_parameter_sweep_results.m` runs the sequential solver for given parameter ranges and analyses relevant results after successful completion.

Otherwise, the sequential and parallel solver can be run in the command line using 

`[mean_solns, peak_offsets, mean_period_length, total_combinations, is_parallel] = ...
          Hes1_tissue_model_sequential_solve(D_d, h, gamma)`

OR

`[mean_solns, peak_offsets, mean_period_length, total_combinations, is_parallel] = ...
          Hes1_tissue_model_parallel_solve(D_d, h, gamma)`

respectively. In this case, the user has to define the parameter ranges used for `D_d`, `h` and `gamma` manually.

> :warning: **As a warning: both solvers solve all results according to specific requirements which can be a substantial amount of files. If this is not wanted, it is best to comment out the corresponding lines using the `save` and `saveas` commands.**

### Tests
The tests are split into two files `Hes1_tissue_model_unit_tests.m` and `Hes1_tissue_model_performance_tests` which can be run individually using the command line inputs

`runtests('Hes1_tissue_model_unit_tests')`

OR

`runperf('Hes1_tissue_model_performance_tests')`.

Alternatively, the script `run_tests.m` runs both the unit and performance tests as well as generating a graphical overview of the performance test.
